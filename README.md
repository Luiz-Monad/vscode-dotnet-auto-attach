# VS Code - DotNet Auto Atach

The "DotNet Auto Attach" extension is created to enable a seemless debugging experience when working with dotnet-watch. While dotnet-watch will rebuild and launch your application everytime you change and store a file, you have to manually restart the debugger each time.

This is where "DotNet Auto Attach" comes in and shines. After dotnet-watch restarts your application, it will attach the debugger to enable a seemless debugging experience while changing files on the fly.

## Features

> Tip: Many popular extensions utilize animations. This is an excellent way to show off your extension! We recommend short, focused animations that are easy to follow.
